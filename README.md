# multispecies-qpad-detectability
This repository serves as the main project for the development of a multi-species model of QPAD detectability, incorporting species phylogeny and traits. Below is information regarding each directory.

## /article
Will serve as the main directory for the article to be written for this project.

## /data
Contains two subdirectories:
 1) /raw: contains all data that I have placed in the folder that the scripts use. I.e., these are data NOT generated by this repository (but could have been generated elsewhere. 
 2) /generated: contains all data that *this* repository generated, and is to be used in future scripts for this repository. It is not necessarily a results folder, just intermediate data.
 
See [the Data README file](https://github.com/BrandonEdwards/multispecies-qpad-detectability/blob/main/data/README.md/) for more information on each data file.

## /models
Contains the stan model files to be used.

## /output
Contains the main output for this repository. These can be interpreted as final tables or plots. 

## /src
Contains all scripts that should be run. See [the Scripts README file](https://github.com/BrandonEdwards/multispecies-qpad-detectability/blob/main/src/README.md/) for more information on each script.
